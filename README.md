# AirBnB_clone
## The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
Only a subset of the features are implemented, necessary to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

## Project Brief
The project contains a complete web application composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data represented by objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Concepts covered
- Unittest
- Python packages concept page
- Object serialization and deserialization
- *args, **kwargs
- datetime

## Technologies used
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- code follow the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- `Unitest` for testing python files: ``python3 -m unittest <FILE>``
